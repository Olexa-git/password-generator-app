# Frontend Mentor - Password generator app solution

## Overview

Pasword generator which include such parameters:
- Uppercase
- Lowercase
- Numbers
- Symbols
Char length from 6 to 20
The password function is quite simple and due to that, it's not warranted that all parameters will be included in a password each time user generates it. The longer password - the more chances that all parameters will be included.

3 layouts included:
Desctop - 1440px;
Tablet - 768px;
Mobile - 375px;
